I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Angelo Cangelosi 
for all his patience, guidance and constructive suggestions during the research and 
development of my final year project. 

I also want to thank my school teachers, my friends, my family for their encouragement 
and support throughout my studies. 

Finally, I wish to thank my university, all my lecturers, my friends, 
my family for their solicitude and all the staffs at the airport, hospital, hotel 
for their help throughout the COVID-19 outbreak.

Without your help, none of this would have been possible.
