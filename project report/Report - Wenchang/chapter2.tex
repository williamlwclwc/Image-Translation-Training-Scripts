\label{cha:review}
In this chapter, I will introduce how solving these kinds of image-to-image
translation tasks with GANs are originated, how the following models trying 
to improve the results, as well as details of two state-of-the-art models.

Dealing Image-to-Image translation tasks with GANs originated from Isola et al.\cite{pix2pix2016}.
